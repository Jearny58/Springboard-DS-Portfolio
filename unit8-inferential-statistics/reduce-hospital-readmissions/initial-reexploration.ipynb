    "# _Hospital Readmissions Data Analysis, Recommendations for Reduction, and Machine Learning_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "In October 2012, the US government's Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) began reducing Medicare payments for Inpatient Prospective Payment System hospitals with excess readmissions. Excess readmissions are measured by a ratio, by dividing a hospital’s number of “predicted” 30-day readmissions for heart attack, heart failure, and pneumonia by the number that would be “expected,” based on an average hospital with similar patients. A ratio greater than 1 indicates excess readmissions.\n",

    "## _Motivation for This Project_\n",
    "\n",
    "During Springboard's Data Science Career Track, this was a project that have the following primary goals:\n",
    "+ critique a preliminary analysis of readmissions data and recommendations (provided below) for reducing the readmissions rate\n",
    "+ construct a statistically sound analysis and make recommendations of your own \n",
    "\n",
    "However, I'm going to take a step back and start this project again, from scratch. I believe that my skills have grown significantly since the time I first did this particular project. This will give me the opportunity to take a deep dive and potentially even develop a machine learning model that can predict which hospitals will have excess readmissions. \n",

As a result, I had a lackluster understanding of the underlying data, and while most of the models I generated were above-average, I can only imagine what their performance would have been like if I had done a more in-depth exploration of the data and the relationships within it. \n",
