# Winning is the Name of the Game: Predicting Individual NBA Player Win Shares

The primary purpose of this project is to solve the following question: "can we predict an individual player's win share per game?" More specifically, the statistic is win share per 48 minutes played (which is equivalent to 1 game). When scouting potential players, scouts often use what is called the 'eye test', which is a highly subjective measure of a player's talent. Players that often pass the eye test are very physically gifted which cause scouts to ignore glaring holes they may have when it comes to the stat line. However, analytics has revolutionized how players are evaluated not only in the NBA but in other professional sports as well. In summary, this project is able to take a wide-breadth of data from the past 10 NBA seasons and create ana algorithm that is able to predict an NBA player's win share to within a few percentage points.
